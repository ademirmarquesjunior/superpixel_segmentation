Abstract: Oil and gas reservoirs are well studied in petroleum engineering using seismic data to estimate fluid flow and well placement. However, seismic data cannot capture fractures due to their scale, and fractures may affect rock porosity and permeability. Consequently, rock fracture segmentation and quantification from aerial images of analogous outcrops can input essential information into those studies. This paper addresses the fracture segmentation problem through the Image Foresting Transform (IFT) -- a tool for the design of image operators based on optimum connectivity. First, the image is segmented into superpixels. By defining a superpixel graph and user-selected seed superpixels, fractures can be delineated by one of two proposed IFT algorithms. This strategy considerably increases computational efficiency while reducing human effort in fracture segmentation compared to manual annotation in a pixel-by-pixel fashion. We evaluate our algorithms with multiple specialists using the same set of 20 images to account for bias among human interpretations and to generate a dataset with consolidated annotation for future work. The interpretation (segmentation) time among users fluctuated between 80 and 200 minutes for the entire set, and the average F1 score ranged between 0.86 and 0.93, showing significant variation among users while demonstrating a valid showcase of the proposed algorithms.
